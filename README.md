# How has the relationship between trade in services (as a percentage of GDP) and inflation (consumer prices, annual %) evolved in The Bahamas between 1980 and 2015?

## Abstract

Using World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI), this study examines the relationship between trade in services (% of GDP) and inflation (consumer prices, annual %) in The Bahamas between 1980 and 2015. Over this period, inflation declined slightly overall, reflecting gradual stabilization of consumer prices. By contrast, trade in services—historically a central pillar of the Bahamian economy—fell by nearly 50%, with the most dramatic drop occurring between 1996 and 1997. This divergence underscores that while macroeconomic price stability was broadly maintained, the service trade sector experienced substantial structural decline. The findings highlight the multidimensional nature of development in small, service-dependent economies, where resilience in one domain does not guarantee stability in another.

## 1. Question

How has the relationship between trade in services (as a percentage of GDP) and inflation (consumer prices, annual %) evolved in The Bahamas between 1980 and 2015?

- **Service trade proxy**: Trade in services (% of GDP)
- **Inflation proxy**: Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)

## 2. Data

- **Source**: World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)
- **Indicators**:
  - Trade in services (% of GDP)
  - Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)
- **Coverage**: The Bahamas, 1980–2015
- **Notes**: National-level data only

## 3. Method

1. Filtered dataset for The Bahamas.
2. **Selected relevant columns**: Year, Indicator Name, Value.
3. Pivoted indicators into separate columns and sorted by year.
4. Produced a dual-axis line graph comparing service trade and inflation trends.

(Analysis is descriptive; no causal inference applied.)

## 4. Results

- **Trade in services (% of GDP)**: Declined significantly by about 50% over the period, with an especially sharp drop between 1996 and 1997.
- **Inflation (% annual)**: Decreased slightly overall, showing moderate stabilization of consumer prices.
- **Comparison**: While inflation trended downward, trade in services declined steeply, indicating diverging trajectories between external service trade and domestic price stability.

## 5. Interpretation

- The Bahamas maintained relative price stability, consistent with efforts to manage consumer inflation.
- Service trade’s decline reflects structural vulnerabilities in a tourism- and service-dependent economy, including global competition, regional shocks, and changes in external demand.
- The divergence demonstrates that macroeconomic stability in prices can coexist with sector-specific weakness, underscoring the importance of diversification strategies for small economies.

## 6. Limitations

- Analysis focuses only on two indicators; other macroeconomic and sectoral variables (e.g., tourism arrivals, foreign direct investment, exchange rates) are excluded.
- National-level data may obscure differences between sub-sectors within services.
- Descriptive analysis only; causal mechanisms are not tested.

## 7. Next Steps / Extensions

- Investigate sector-specific trends within services (e.g., tourism vs financial services) to identify which areas drove the decline.
- Examine the impact of regional/global shocks—such as hurricanes, financial crises, and shifts in travel demand—on service trade.
- Compare The Bahamas with other Caribbean economies to assess whether similar service trade contractions occurred.
- Explore econometric methods to test whether inflation stabilization contributed indirectly to changes in trade competitiveness.
